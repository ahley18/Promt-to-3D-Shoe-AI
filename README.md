# Promt-to-3D-Shoe-AI
An AI-powered system that transforms text prompts into realistic 3D shoe models using deep learning and generative techniques. This project leverages advanced neural networks to generate detailed, customizable footwear designs from simple textual descriptions. 🚀👟

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- LLM and 3D GenAI models from Stability AI

## 📌 How to Use
1. **Run the Script**: Execute the main script by running:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. **Provide a Prompt**: Enter a text description of the desired shoe design.
3. **Generate & Visualize**: The AI will process the prompt and generate a 3D model of the shoe.

## 🚀 Features
- Converts text descriptions into 3D shoe models
- Uses advanced LLM and GenAI techniques
- Supports customizable and high-fidelity designs
